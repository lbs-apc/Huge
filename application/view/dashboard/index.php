        <p>
            This is an area that's only visible for logged in users. Try to log out, an go to /dashboard/ again. You'll
            be redirected to /index/ as you are not logged in. You can protect a whole section in your app within the
            according controller by placing <i>Auth::handleLogin();</i> into the constructor.
